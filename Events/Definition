What are Events and Event Handlers ?


Events are actions that happen in the webpage like clicking a button or submit the form. If the user selects a button on a webpage, we might want to respond to that action by displaying an alert on the webpage. Each available event has an event handler, which is a block of code that runs when the event occurred. Event handlers are sometimes called event listeners. The listener listens out for the event happening, and the handler is the code that is run in response to it happening. There are many ways to assign a handler.
